        <h1>A journey through time</h1>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">. . .</h1>
        <p class="description">
          My journey has been an exhilirating experience. From my uncertainty
          and hesistance in creating a project to a full-on participation in a
          social intervention project aiming at providing a basic necessity to a
          community. Throughout this journey, I believe I have strengthened in a
          myriad of areas. My first CAS project was the website
          <b><a href="https://resourceify.com">Resourceify</a></b
          >. This project strengthened my knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascipt,
          programming languages used for web development. Morevoer, the schedule
          I planned to finish this CAS project by a set date strengthened my
          organisational skills. More so, I learnt the intricacies of hosting a
          website and obtaining a domain name, an eye-opener.<br /><br />Subsequently,
          I participated in a virtual
          <b>Model United Nations Conference</b> which went a long way to
          improve my debating and rebuttal skills. The poise, the pizzazz with
          which I delivered my opening speech as the delegate of the
          <b>Democratic People's Republic of Korea</b> was unmatched. Venturing
          into the TIS Mooting Society and the Buddies Without Borders Online
          Forum, I further improved my speaking and argumentative skills.
          Researching the injustices in our soceity and those of my assigned
          country (China) through the Buddies without Borders Online Forum
          increased my awareness of issues I didn't know previously existed. The
          fury edged on my face as I learnt that people are victims of the
          capital punishment (the death penalty) because they did something as
          simple as accept an envelope with money under the table. In the
          culminating session, we presented on solutions to combat injustices in
          our assigned countries, in the form of a presentation and a research
          paper. Although we did not find the magic solution to solving all of
          the injustices, it was fulfilling to engage with issues of global
          significance.<br />
          <br />Who can forget
          <b>the Duke of Edinburgh expedition at Trident Island</b>? What a
          rollercoaster ride! We did not get off to a great start as the rain
          punctuated our hiking, drenched us and forced us to seek shelter in an
          uncompleted building. The feeling of the cold air kissing my skin and
          water running down the floor as I retired to my tent on the first day
          was quite novel to me. The joy of paintballing and kayaking, the
          terror of abseiling, summed up for quite a memorable experience. This
          expedition took me out of my comfort zone, quite literally. From
          staying in-doors to exploring living with nature for consecutive days,
          I learnt the value of utilising resources efficiently. Shoutout to my
          friends, the cotton stainers, who kept me company in my tent, trying
          to catch my attention as I drifted off to sleep.<br />
          <br />
          <b>The Protect the Guides CAS Initiative</b> was one of many projects
          I enjoyed being a part of, preparing and selling macaroni and cheese
          as a means to raise funds to fund Covid-19 supplies to the Ghana
          Girl's Guide Association to enable them to conduct their Annual Summer
          Program.<br /><br />Shifting our attention from food, we move on to a
          CAS project that aimed to brighten up someone's day with the use of
          motivational quotes designed on canvases:The
          <b>"Uplifting with Words"</b> CAS Project. We aimed to siphon the
          power of words to bring a smile to people's faces. With the dedication
          and hard work of the team members, we realised our goal. <br /><br />
          What better way to end my CAS journey than by having a hand in helping
          a community around me. What better way to end this 2-year spell than
          being part of the <b>Do Great Things CAS Project</b>, a CAS project
          which aimed to provide clean water for communities in Ghana.
          Initially, we partnered with the Kojo Jones Mensah (KJM) Foundation,
          who provided us with a list of towns in need of clean and potable
          water to choose. From there onwards, the ball was in our court. We
          unanimously chose "Fotobi", which we felt topped the list because of
          the distance the inhabitants covered to fetch water and the
          frequency with which they were victims of snake bites on their way to
          get access to a basic necessity. Raising $4000 was tricky. We sent out
          letters to reputable companies in Ghana, which included Vivo Energy,
          Nestle Ghana, and Ghana Oil (GOIL), as well as to our parents. After
          quite a while, only a few funds had trickled in, a few of the
          companies unable to come to our aid and others yet to respond to our
          letter. What we had was nowhere near our target. We started panicking.
          How were we going to raise such a volumnous amount of money? Then, our
          wonderful CAS Coordinator, Surama King, provided us with the most
          unexpected of news during one after school meeting. "GOIL has donated
          GH¢ 23,000 to your project", she exclaimed. We were astounded. We had
          reached our goal. Everything else fell into place after GOIL's
          donation, and we commisioned the borehole on the 9th of December, 2021
          with quite a wonderful ceremony. I would like to extend a warm
          gratitude to my teammates for showing empathy and tackling such a
          pressing societal issue, to Mama Su for her immense support from the
          beginning and to the KJM foundation for their coorperation. This
          project, coupled with the "Protect the Guides CAS Initiative",
          "Buddies Without Borders Online forum" and "Uplifting With Words CAS
          Project" helped me immensely develop my collaborative skills. It is
          one thing to just listen to people's ideas and another thing taking
          them into consideration. With my participation in these projects and
          experiences, I learned to do the latter.<br /><br />It is said that
          "Growth is uncomfortable, you have to embrace the discomfort if you
          want to expand". I believe I have done so in these 2 years. In
          retrospect, I believe this core component of the IB Diploma program
          has shaped me into a more empathetic, collaborative, focused,
          outspoken human being and I hope to exhibit these qualities in my
          future endeavors. Thank you Mama Su and thank you to everyone who in
          some way or form contributed to making my CAS journey a success.
